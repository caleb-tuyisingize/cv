          Hi! My name is <strong>Caleb Tuyisingize</strong>. Iâ€™m a passionate IT student at <strong>RP Tumba College of Technology</strong> and currently undergoing hands-on trainings at <strong>GYM Rwanda</strong>. I enjoy learning and building web technologies, solving programming challenges, and creating projects that make a real impact.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          I have experience with <strong>JavaScript (ES6+), React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, HTML, and CSS</strong>. Beyond coding, I have also trained other students in System-Oriented Development (SOD) using these technologies, helping them build practical web applications.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and always seeking opportunities to learn and improve. I enjoy combining my academic knowledge with practical experience to deliver projects that are both functional and user-friendly.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Outside of technology, I also enjoy sports like basketball, which help me stay focused, energized, and disciplined in my personal and professional life.
